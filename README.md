# employee-attrition-ml

This project involves building a neural network based model to predict employee attrition (whether an employee leaves the company) based on a variety of factors such as age, years worked, and monthly income. 

The publicly available IBM employee attrition is used as the starting dataset. A 1-hidden-layer neural network will be built with a softmax one-hot output. 

Exploratory data analysis is performed in IBM Attrition EDA.ipynb and the actual model is built up in network.py.
